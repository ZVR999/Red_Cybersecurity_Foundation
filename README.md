# Red_Cybersecurity_Foundation


A collection of terms and exercises to help promote the competency that I have regarding the red team side of cybersecurity!

After completing the exercise: Pentest Academy Command Injection Walkthrough:: I will be changing the format of the exercises to be more report-like with PDFs. This way you can see how I'm thinking, what I'm doing, etc. all on the same report. Got to get used to writing reports right? xD

IMPORTANT: The template seen in the https://github.com/ZVR999/Portfolio repository (Report_Template.pdf) will be used to help display professionalism in addition to proof of skills.
